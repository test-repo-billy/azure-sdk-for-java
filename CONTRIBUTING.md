Azure SDK for Java Contributing Guide
-------------------------------------

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Azure SDK for Java.

- For reporting bugs, requesting features, or asking for support, please file an issue in the [issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues) section of the project.

- If you would like to become an active contributor to this project please follow the instructions provided in [Microsoft Azure Projects Contribution Guidelines](http://azure.github.com/guidelines.html).

- To make code changes, or contribute something new, please follow the [GitHub Forks / Pull requests model](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/): Fork the repo, make the change and propose it back by submitting a pull request.

- Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Building#testing-for-spotbugs-and-checkstyle-issues) to learn about how Azure SDK for java generates CheckStyle, SpotBugs, Jacoco, and JavaDoc reports.

- There are two Maven projects in the repo. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Building#pomclientxml-vs-pomdataxml) to learn about project structure for each.

Pull Requests
-------------

* **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
* **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs.  A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.
* **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. "Improve code coverage for Azure.Core by 10%", not "Fix #1234")
* **DO** refer to any relevant issues, and include [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
* **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
* **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds.  The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it'll be merged.
* **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary.  This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.
* **DO** assume that ["Squash and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) will be used to merge your commit unless you request otherwise in the PR.
* **DO NOT** fix merge conflicts using a merge commit. Prefer `git rebase`.
* **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.

Merging Pull Requests (for project contributors with write access)
----------------------------------------------------------

* **DO** use ["Squash and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) by default for individual contributions unless requested by the PR author.
  Do so, even if the PR contains only one commit. It creates a simpler history than "Create a Merge Commit".
  Reasons that PR authors may request "Merge and Commit" may include (but are not limited to):

  - The change is easier to understand as a series of focused commits. Each commit in the series must be buildable so as not to break `git bisect`.
  - Contributor is using an e-mail address other than the primary GitHub address and wants that preserved in the history. Contributor must be willing to squash
    the commits manually before acceptance.



## Developer Guide

### Pre-requisites
- Install Java Development Kit 8
  - add `JAVA_HOME` to environment variables
- Install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
  - add `MAVEN_HOME` to environment variables


>**Note:** If you are on `Windows`, enable paths longer than 260 characters by: <br><br>
1.- Run this as Administrator on a command prompt:<br> 
`REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1`<br>*(might need to type `yes` to override key if it already exists)*<br><br>
2.- Set up `git` by running:<br> `git config --system core.longpaths true`

### Building and Testing
The easiest way to build is by running the following command from the root folder:
```
mvn -f pom.client.xml -Dgpg.skip -DskipTests clean install
```
- `-f pom.client.xml`: tells maven to target latest Azure SDK for Java project.
- `-Dgpg.skip`: disables [gpg](https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2016-12-19/web/packages/gpg/vignettes/intro.html) signing.
- `-DskipTests:` Building without running unit tests would speed operation up, however, make sure all tests pass before creating a new PR.
- `clean:` will remove any previous generated output.
- `install:`  compiles project and installs it in the local Maven cache.

>**Note**: Refer to [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Building) for learning about how to build using Java 11

### Compiling one project only
```
mvn -f sdk/{projectForlderDir}/pom.xml -Dgpg.skip clean install

//example: mvn -f sdk/keyvault/azure-security-keyvault-keys/pom.xml clean install
```
